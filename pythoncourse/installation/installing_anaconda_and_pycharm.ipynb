You can also down a lot of this material from https://github.com/cuemacro/teaching - in particular the scripts for installing the conda environments. We'll also be installing a lot of other useful libraries for machine learning, natural language processing etc."

First check if you have a GPU accelerated graphics card which supports CUDA (usually most newer NVIDIA graphics cards). This means you can install GPU accelerated versions of machine libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. \n",

Once you've done that you can edit the scripts below where indicated, so the GPU enabled Python versions of PyTorch and TensorFlow are installed (rather than the CPU version). Note, the CPU versions work fine, but will be slower!"
